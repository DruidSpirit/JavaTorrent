---
This extensions allows to connect with a tracker on a UDP endpoint. The overhead on a UDP-endpoint is significantly lower compared to the HTTP variant.
This extension is mostly designed to reduce load on the tracker end. For the client this protocol does exactly the same as the HTTP trackers combined with
BEP #23.

## Usage

```java
TorrentClient = new TorrentClient.Builder()
    .registerModule(new UdpTrackerModule.Builder().build())
    // ... other configuration
    .build();
```
